# DClassAmp
attempt at a discrete D class amp while also messing around

# V0.0.0
- First attempt worked surprisingly well if you ignore all the bodges. *Challenge: find all the mistakes I made :P*
- Triangle wave generator has a surprising amount of jitter created by the ripple counter and makes a good white noise generator!
